# Collect

This directory contains scripts for collecting data from the wifi interface. 
These scripts primarily rely on aircrack and its built-in wifi parsing
capabilities, but this can also be done with Scapy or another specialized
tool. Aircrack is simply the easiest route.

## AircrackIntervals.py

Script `AircrackIntervals.py`:
* A script to collect data from the interface. 
* New files are created at specified time intervals.
* Total number of files collected is specified.
