# ugr-wifi-2017

Files related to the South Seattle College Undergraduate Research (UGR) Project, entitled "Wireless Sensor Networks for Internet of Things Applications."

This project took place during Winter and Spring 2017 at South Seattle College, under the supervision of myself (Dr. Charles Reid). 

## Project Description

This project was a low-cost undergraduate research project htat involved the use of Raspberry Pis to capture and analyze
large data sets about wifi signals. The students wrote Python code to capture wifi data onboard the Raspberry Pis using the 
aircrack-ng suite. They then stored the data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB) on a virtual private server. Finally, the students
used Jupyter notebooks to interface with MongoDB from Python, write queries, analyze data, and visualize the results.

## Project Participants

The following students participated:
* Phuong Tran
* Shelby Mirziteh
* Jadon Combs
* Thy Lee
* Angela Flores

## Project Poster

This research was presented in a poster session at the 
[University of Washington Undergraduate Research Symposium](http://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/symposium/).
